Around one third of our brain is used for vision.  That is a huge fraction if you think that we have to budget for the rest of our senses and abilities.  I don't want to get into all the parts of the brain that are devoted to vision, though.  I just want to talk about the retina.
absorb (retina)
basic processing and delegate (primary)
movement (parietal)
content (temporal)


When I started learning about vision, I knew about some mainstream terms, but not much about the neurons that make it all work.  Cones are the cells that are senstive to certain types of color, and rods are sensitive to light.


So what does the retina do?  
The retina actually processes the light that hits the cones in an interesting way.  It was actually discovered by accident by Hubel.  Naturally you'd think that each cone or rod relays its information through the optic nerve to the primary visual cortex, but there is a little processing going on in the retina before that happens.  The cones sense the light, and connect with three other types of cells before relaying to the Ganglion cells which make up the optic nerve.  This circuit activates the ganglion cell based on a center surround receptive field.

The center surround orientation is key for detecting lines and movement of lines.
